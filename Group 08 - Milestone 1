--Executive Summary--
The final product of this project will be an informative news-website focused on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The website will use two main APIs. One will be a coronavirus API for raw data, the other will be a news API which will filter for articles mentioning the pandemic across multiple sources. Each article will have a related discussion forum in which users can comment their thoughts on the article. Due to normal new sources having a focus in a variety of areas, it can sometimes be hard to find up-to-date information on the pandemic specifically. The main advantage of this website is it will compile all these articles into one place. Additionally, the private forum will allow users to express their thoughts and feel connected.
